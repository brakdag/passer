**Paser** (originally called "Passer", after _Passer domesticus_) is an autonomous agent powered by Google's Gemini model (via the `google-genai` SDK) that employs the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** pattern to execute local functions transparently for the user. Designed and optimized for **Debian/Linux** systems.

The name change from "Passer" to "Paser" (repository: `brakdag/passer`) simplifies terminal typing while maintaining the root of the original name and the meaning linked to the house sparrow, a very common bird in southern Mendoza.

## Installation

You can choose between cloning the repository (for development) or running the installation script directly:

### Option 1: Quick Installation (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brakdag/paser/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Option 2: Clone from Repository (For Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brakdag/paser.git && cd paser && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

## Credentials Configuration

To allow Paser to interact with external services, you must configure the following environment variables in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
# API Key for the Gemini model
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"

# Personal access token for GitHub (required for managing issues)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
```

## Execution

Once installed and configured, you can run the application simply by using:

```bash
paser
```

## Main Features

1.  **Local Function Calling (Manual):**
    - Does not use native Google SDK tools.
    - Uses _System Instructions_ to force the model to emit structured calls (`<TOOL_CALL>`).
    - The script acts as a _middleware_ that intercepts these calls, executes the local function, and returns the result in `<TOOL_RESPONSE>` format to the model's history.
    - *Note: Modifying `paser/tools/registry.py` autonomously can be unstable due to the tool interceptor (see [Issue #110](https://github.com/brakdag/passer/issues/110)). The complex string construction of `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` (using `chr()` and `.replace()`) is a mandatory workaround to prevent the middleware from misinterpreting the code as a tool call; do not simplify or "clean up" this implementation.*

2.  **Security and File Control:**
    - All file operations (read, write, delete) are restricted to the current working directory defined by `PROJECT_ROOT` through a secure path validation function (`get_safe_path`).
    - File deletion requires interactive confirmation (`y/n`).

3.  **User Commands:**
    - `/models`: Change the AI model and adjust temperature.
    - `/thinking`: Toggle the visibility of the model's internal reasoning (thoughts).
    - `/cd <path>`: Change the agent's working directory.
    - `/t`: Display the current context window token count.
    - `/history`: Show a summary of tools executed during the session.
    - `/session`: List and load previously saved sessions.
    - `/reset`: Save the current session and restart the application.
    - `/max_turns <n>`: Set the maximum number of autonomous turns to prevent infinite loops.
    - `/clear` or `/cls`: Clear the terminal screen.
